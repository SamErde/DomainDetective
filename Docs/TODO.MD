# DomainDetective Enhanced Reporting System - TODO

## üîç Assessment of Current State

### Current Implementation
- Basic HTML reports with simple layouts (BasicDomainReport, SimpleDomainReport, DomainSecurityReport)
- Limited visual appeal - mostly text-based data grids
- Basic scoring system (0-100) with simple risk levels
- No interactive elements or deep-dive capabilities
- No charting or visual representations
- Limited export options (HTML only in current reports)
- No multi-language support
- No integration with PowerShell/CLI for report generation

### HtmlForgeX Capabilities Available
- **DataGrid**: Advanced data display with badges, status indicators, avatars, icons
- **InfoCards**: Beautiful colorful cards with custom backgrounds and progress bars
- **DataTables**: Interactive tables with search, export (Excel, CSV, PDF), pagination
- **Charts**: Various chart types for visual data representation
- **Smart Wizard**: Step-by-step guides for remediation
- **VisNetwork**: Network graphs for relationship visualization
- **Tabler Components**: Full UI framework with responsive design
- **Code Highlighting**: For displaying DNS records with syntax highlighting

### Competitor Analysis (from Demo screenshots)
- **SENDMARC**: Category-based scoring (Impersonation, Privacy, Branding), visual score gauges
- **Mailhardener**: Detailed protocol breakdowns, DNS record syntax highlighting, implementation guides
